It's an old python project. Its main purpose is demonstration how bot game could be made from novice perspective.
I used open cv and pygui to simulate user input. It works quite well although some events like fishing in ocean works differently than usual river fishing because of the height difference. Probably solution based on ML would be much better. Solution using audio could work nicely too. Have fun playing with it xd
